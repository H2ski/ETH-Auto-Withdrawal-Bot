# ETH-Auto-Withdrawal-Bot
It is an application (most often coded in python) linked to an ETH Wallet by its 24 words key. The principle is that the victim deposits eth on the backdoored wallet hoping to withdraw the amount from the Honeypot, the eth deposited will then be directly sucked by the bot to your wallet defined in the application beforehand!
